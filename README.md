# 🔍 Key Insights & Findings

Our analysis of the OmniMart dataset uncovered the following highlights:

- **Youthful, Medium-Income Base:** The majority of customers are 18–35, medium-income, and spend ~Rs.255 per transaction → focus marketing on youth-oriented platforms, trend-driven products, and flexible payment options like BNPL.

- **Spending Behavior:** Spending is not strongly tied to age or income but correlates positively with the number of purchases, indicating frequency is a stronger driver of total revenue.

- **Logistics Bottlenecks:** Order cancellations are highest for the Standard Shipping method, indicating inefficiencies in delivery systems and the need to optimize shipping logistics.

- **Seasonal Demand:** The data shows a massive revenue spike in December, confirming the holiday season as our most critical sales period.

- **Category Drivers:** A Small Number of Products Drive a Large Volume of Sales. This indicates a power Law Distribution.
